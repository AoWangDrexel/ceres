				<p> How much do you know about the Australian bushfires? </p>
				<p> Despite all the media coverage and all the support, the Australian bushfires are still a major issue which is why it's so important to
					maintain and bring awareness to this situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Australia deals with bushfires yearly, the 2019-2020 season definitely stands out for its intensity and impact on the country. 
					Some of the effects include destroying homes and animal habitats, causing smoke trails, and even affecting Australia's economy and tourism.
					Furthermore, despite the January rainfall, the bushfires are still a concern and many are worried for what’s to come.
