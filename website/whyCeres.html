				<h3>Why Ceres</h3>
				<p>There are a ton of websites that provide you constant and accessible information about the Australian bushfires. But why choose Ceres? </p>
				<p>One of the main reasons is because Ceres makes use of reliable information. More specifically, we use EarthData provided by NASA as our main source of data. EarthData uses 2 satellites to collect the data: VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imagin Spectroradiometer). With these 2 satellites: EarthData can detect where the fires are active for every 1-2 days. </p>
				<p>More information can be found in NASA's FAQ <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/faq/firms-faq">here</a>. </p>
              </p>
<p>Now for what we've done, after locating that data from this source, we will download the data as a .csv file and clean up the data as much as we possibly can to ensure that the website understands everything we feed it. Additionally, there is a brightness category in the file that measures the fires in Kelvin. Finally, we upload the data onto our map with custom pointers to ensure that everyone can clearly see what is going on in Australia. Furthermore, we strive to keep our data relevant by updating this often.</p>
