				<h4> About </h4>
				<p> 
					Ceres is a website dedicated to spreading and promoting awareness to the current wildfires in Australia.
					It features an interactive map, news feed, and additional information for people to not only learn more
					about the sitation, but also about how they can help. 					
				</p>
				<p> 
					Like our slogan, we believe that if people actually see the fires and learn more about them, then they
					will be equipped with the knowledge to actually fight the fire. We hope that everyone that uses this 
					website comes out learning something new.
